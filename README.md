# Rust Sand Tetris

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tetris using the Rust programming language with a twist. I am aware that similar variant of this game already exists, I took huge inspiration from that.
This is my second project in rust, and one to help me understand the language better.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. If you don't have Rust installed, you can follow the official installation guide [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once you have Rust installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/Newtoneiro/rust_sand_tetris.git
cd rust-sand-tetris
```

## Usage

To build and run the game, use the following command:

```
cargo run
```
This will compile the code and start the game.

### Controls

- Use the WASD keys to move the falling blocks.
- Use E for clockwise rotation, and Q for counter clockwise.
- R restarts the game.

The goal is to complete rows by filling them with blocks, which will then be cleared, giving you points.
